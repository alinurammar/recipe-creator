# PantryPal - Your Personalized Recipe Generator

Welcome to the PantryPal frontend repository! PantryPal is an innovative tool that generates personalized recipes based on the ingredients you have on hand. Say goodbye to food waste and hello to delicious meals crafted by AI.

This project was booted with Create React App, and it's designed to work in conjunction with our backend services to provide recipe suggestions and a seamless cooking experience.

## Running PantryPal Locally

To run PantryPal on your local machine, you'll need to have Node.js installed. Once you have the repository cloned and Node.js ready, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
make frontend-run
```
This command will start the React application in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to view and interact with the application.

## Exploring the Design
PantryPal's frontend is crafted with a clean, modern design aesthetic, offering an intuitive user interface that makes recipe discovery a breeze. The layout is responsive, ensuring a great experience whether you're on desktop, tablet, or mobile.

From the landing page to the recipe results, each interaction is thoughtfully designed to guide you through the process of finding the perfect recipe for your current pantry items.
